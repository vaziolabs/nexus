# NEXUS Network Suite

## Overview
NEXUS is a simple, secure, scalable DNS-over-QUIC protocol implementation designed for the hypermesh network, providing enhanced security, performance, and scalability features for distributed DNS. Beyond DNS, NEXUS is designed to evolve into a comprehensive network protocol replacement leveraging QUIC's capabilities to handle tunneling, IPv6 allocation, and NAT traversal. NEXUS now integrates Falcon post-quantum cryptography for certificate operations, providing quantum-resistant security for the entire certificate infrastructure.

### Vision: Web3 DNS Service

The ultimate goal of NEXUS is to power **dns.hypermesh.online**, a global Web3 DNS service that revolutionizes domain name registration and resolution:

* **Simplified Domain Names**: Enable direct registration of top-level domains like "nike" or "nascar" without traditional hierarchies
* **Web3 Integration**: Decentralized domain ownership, transfer, and management through blockchain technology
* **Public/Private Network Management**: Allow entities to maintain both public-facing resources and private internal networks
* **HTTP/3 Ready**: Optimized for next-generation HTTP/3 protocols (e.g., http3://nike)
* **Post-Quantum Security**: Resistant to future quantum computing threats through Falcon cryptography
* **Global Resilience**: Distributed architecture ensuring high availability and performance worldwide

NEXUS serves as both the protocol definition and reference implementation for this next-generation DNS system.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Building NEXUS

Clone the repository and build the binaries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaziolabs/nexus.git
cd nexus
make clean && make
```

This builds both the NEXUS daemon (`build/nexus`) and the CLI tool (`build/nexus_cli`).

### 2. Setting Up NEXUS

#### Initial Configuration

Run the configuration wizard to create a basic configuration:

```bash
./build/nexus_cli configure
```

This creates a default configuration with a private mode profile in `~/.config/nexus/config.json`.

#### Manual Configuration

You can also create configuration files manually in `~/.config/nexus/profiles/` for more control.

Example profile configuration file (`~/.config/nexus/profiles/home.json`):
```json
{
  "name": "home",
  "mode": "private",
  "hostname": "home.local",
  "server": "home.local",
  "server_port": 10053,
  "client_port": 10443,
  "ipv6_prefix": "fd00:1234:5678::",
  "ipv6_prefix_length": 64,
  "max_tunnels": 10,
  "auto_connect": true,
  "enable_nat_traversal": true,
  "enable_relay": false,
  "enable_ct": true
}
```

### 3. Running NEXUS

#### Starting the Daemon

Start NEXUS with a specific profile:

```bash
./build/nexus --profile home
```

Or run it with direct parameters:

```bash
./build/nexus --mode private --hostname home.local --server home.local
```

#### Running as a Service

To run NEXUS as a background service:

```bash
./build/nexus --service
```

This will load the default profile or all profiles with `auto_connect` set to true.

#### Systemd Integration (Linux)

Create a systemd service file `/etc/systemd/system/nexus.service`:

```
[Unit]
Description=NEXUS Network Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/path/to/nexus/build/nexus --service
Restart=on-failure
User=nexus

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable nexus
sudo systemctl start nexus
```

### 4. Using the CLI

The CLI tool interacts with the running daemon to perform various operations.

#### Basic Commands

Check service status:
```bash
./build/nexus_cli status
```

List available profiles:
```bash
./build/nexus_cli list-profiles
```

Show details of a profile:
```bash
./build/nexus_cli show-profile home
```

#### Network Management

Start a profile:
```bash
./build/nexus_cli start home
```

Stop a profile:
```bash
./build/nexus_cli stop home
```

Restart a profile:
```bash
./build/nexus_cli restart home
```

#### Domain Management

Register a new TLD:
```bash
./build/nexus_cli register-tld home example
```

This registers the TLD "example" using the "home" profile, allowing you to resolve names like "server.example".

#### DNS Lookups

Look up a hostname:
```bash
./build/nexus_cli lookup server.example
```

### 5. Multi-Network Configuration

NEXUS supports simultaneous connections to different networks. You can create and manage multiple profiles:

```bash
# Create a profile for work network
./build/nexus_cli add-profile work federated

# Configure the work profile
./build/nexus_cli edit-profile work hostname workstation
./build/nexus_cli edit-profile work server nexus.company.com

# Start both networks
./build/nexus_cli start home
./build/nexus_cli start work
```

### 6. Monitoring and Troubleshooting

#### Check Service Logs

```bash
# If running as a systemd service
sudo journalctl -u nexus -f

# Check configuration files
ls -la ~/.config/nexus/
```

## Testing

### Prerequisites

Before beginning testing, ensure you have:

1. A system with IPv6 enabled
2. The NEXUS software built (`make all`)
3. Sufficient permissions to open network ports

### Testing Methods

NEXUS offers several testing methods, from unit tests to full integration testing:

#### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests verify individual components:

```bash
# Run all unit tests
make test

# Run specific component tests
make test_tld        # TLD Manager
make test_packet     # Packet Protocol
make test_config     # Config Manager
make test_cli        # CLI Interface
make test_ct         # Certificate Transparency
make test_ca         # Certificate Authority
make test_network    # Network Context
```

#### 2. QUIC Handshake Tests

These tests verify the QUIC handshake process:

```bash
# Test basic QUIC handshake
make test_handshake

# Test IPv6 QUIC handshake and certificate verification
make test_ipv6
```

#### 3. Full Integration Testing

The integration test verifies all components working together:

```bash
make integration_test
```

This runs `tests/nexus_integration_test.sh`, which tests:
- Starting servers and clients across multiple networks (private, public, federated)
- IPv6 connectivity
- Certificate creation and validation
- TLD registration
- Domain registration
- DNS resolution
- Data transmission between nodes

Additionally, a dedicated Falcon post-quantum cryptography integration test is available:

```bash
./tests/integration_falcon_test.sh
```

This test specifically focuses on:
- Server and client initialization with Falcon certificates
- Verification of Falcon certificate validation during handshakes
- DNS resolution with Falcon certificate verification
- Data transfer with post-quantum security

Additionally, we now provide a standalone IPv6 Falcon certificate test:

```bash
./tests/run_ipv6_falcon_test.sh
```

This test verifies:
- Generation of Falcon-signed certificates in an IPv6 environment
- Proper certificate verification using Falcon post-quantum signatures
- Cross-verification of certificates between different CAs
- Basic IPv6 functionality even when native IPv6 is not available (using fallback mode)

### Manual Testing

For manual testing, follow these steps:

1. **Start a NEXUS server**:
   ```bash
   ./build/nexus --mode private --hostname server.nexus.local --bind-address ::1 --port 10443
   ```

2. **Start a NEXUS client**:
   ```bash
   ./build/nexus --mode private --hostname client.nexus.local --server ::1 --server-port 10443
   ```

3. **Register a TLD**:
   ```bash
   ./build/nexus_cli --server ::1 --port 10443 register-tld "test"
   ```

4. **Register a domain**:
   ```bash
   ./build/nexus_cli --server ::1 --port 10443 register-domain "example.test" "fd00::1"
   ```

5. **Resolve a domain**:
   ```bash
   ./build/nexus_cli --server ::1 --port 10443 resolve "example.test"
   ```

6. **Verify a certificate**:
   ```bash
   ./build/nexus_cli --server ::1 --port 10443 verify-cert "client.nexus.local"
   ```

7. **Send data**:
   ```bash
   ./build/nexus_cli --server ::1 --port 10443 send-data "server.nexus.local" "Hello NEXUS!"
   ```

### Verifying IPv6 Functionality

NEXUS is designed to work natively with IPv6, providing:
- Full IPv6 support for all connections
- IPv6 address allocation for tunnels
- IPv6-based certificate binding
- IPv6 DNS record storage and resolution

To verify IPv6 functionality:

1. **Check that connections are established over IPv6**:
   ```bash
   ss -tulpn | grep nexus
   ```
   Look for entries with IPv6 addresses (starting with `::`)

2. **Verify DNS resolution returns IPv6 addresses**:
   ```bash
   ./build/nexus_cli --server ::1 --port 10443 resolve "example.test"
   ```
   The result should be an IPv6 address.

3. **Confirm certificates are created for IPv6 connections**:
   ```bash
   ./build/nexus_cli --server ::1 --port 10443 cert-info "client.nexus.local"
   ```
   The certificate should include IPv6 address information.

4. **Test IPv6 QUIC handshake**:
   ```bash
   make test_ipv6
   ```

### Test Implementation

The tests are structured to validate both API functionality and integration between components:

1. **Unit Tests** - Verify individual functions and modules in isolation
2. **Integration Tests** - Test the interaction between multiple components
3. **Mock Components** - Provide controlled test environments
4. **Assertion-Based Testing** - Clear validation of expected behaviors

Each test file follows a consistent pattern with setup, test execution, and cleanup phases to ensure reliable and repeatable testing.

### Troubleshooting

#### Connection Issues

If connections fail:

1. **Verify IPv6 is enabled on your system**:
   ```bash
   ping6 -c 3 ::1
   ```

2. **Check if ports are already in use**:
   ```bash
   ss -tulpn | grep 10443
   ```

3. **Enable debug output**:
   ```bash
   NEXUS_DEBUG=1 ./build/nexus --mode private --hostname test.local
   ```

4. **Examine logs for specific errors**:
   ```bash
   # In integration test mode
   cat logs/server_private_10443.log
   cat logs/client_private_client1.local.log
   ```

#### Certificate Issues

If certificate verification fails:

1. **Check that the CA is properly initialized**:
   ```bash
   ./build/nexus_cli --server ::1 --port 10443 ca-status
   ```

2. **Verify the certificate was created**:
   ```bash
   ./build/nexus_cli --server ::1 --port 10443 list-certs
   ```

#### DNS Resolution Issues

If DNS resolution fails:

1. **Verify the TLD is registered**:
   ```bash
   ./build/nexus_cli --server ::1 --port 10443 list-tlds
   ```

2. **Check that the domain is registered**:
   ```bash
   ./build/nexus_cli --server ::1 --port 10443 list-domains "test"
   ```

### Advanced Testing

After verifying basic functionality, consider testing:

1. **Load Testing**: Multiple simultaneous connections
2. **Failover**: Server/client recovery after connection loss
3. **Cross-Network**: Communication between different network types
4. **Certificate Transparency**: Verify CT logs across network boundaries

## Falcon Post-Quantum Cryptography

NEXUS now integrates the Falcon post-quantum signature algorithm for certificate operations, providing quantum-resistant security throughout the system.

### Features

- **Post-Quantum Secure Certificates**: All certificates are generated and verified using Falcon signatures
- **CA Infrastructure**: Certificate Authority operations use Falcon for key generation and certificate signing
- **Certificate Transparency**: CT logs use Falcon signatures for tamper-proof verification
- **Certificate Verification**: Certificate validation during QUIC handshakes uses Falcon verification

### Testing Falcon Integration

You can verify the Falcon integration with the following tests:

```bash
# Run standalone CA tests to verify Falcon key generation and certificate operations
make test_ca

# Run standalone CT tests to verify Falcon signature handling in certificate transparency
make test_ct

# Run the dedicated Falcon integration test
./tests/integration_falcon_test.sh
```

The integration test verifies:
- Falcon certificate generation during server/client initialization
- Falcon certificate validation during connection handshakes
- DNS resolution with Falcon-verified certificates
- Data transfer with Falcon certificate validation

### CLI Commands for Falcon Verification

The CLI interface has been updated to display Falcon certificate validation status:

```bash
# Check certificate status (will show Falcon validation)
./build/nexus_cli status

# Verify a specific certificate using Falcon
./build/nexus_cli verify-cert <hostname>
```

### Integration Points

Falcon has been integrated at several key points in the system:
- Key generation in the CA module
- Certificate signing operations
- Certificate verification during handshakes
- Certificate Transparency log signatures
- DNS-level certificate validation during resolution

## Building

```bash
make clean && make
```


#### Debug Mode

Run the daemon with verbose logging:
```bash
NEXUS_DEBUG=1 ./build/nexus --profile home
```

#### Verify Connections

```bash
# Check if service is running
./build/nexus_cli status

# Test DNS resolution
./build/nexus_cli lookup test.example
```

## Architecture Components
1. **NEXUS Client**: Sends/receives DNS requests over QUIC, operates in dual client/server mode to enable decentralized communications across multiple NEXUS servers.

2. **NEXUS Server**: Dedicated server that handles requests from multiple NEXUS clients.

3. **NEXUS Resolver**: Queries other resolvers within the hypermesh network to resolve DNS requests.

These components can run on the same machine or be distributed across different systems.

## Operation Modes
- **Private Mode**: Acts as both client and server on the same node. Enables registration of private domains for internal use within a private hypermesh network. Each node operates as its own host and mirror for redundancy.

- **Public Mode**: Connects to established NEXUS network (e.g., dns.hypermesh.online) to access globally registered domains. Acts primarily as a client to query TLDs from the network.

- **Federated Mode**: Operates as both client and server, but connects to other NEXUS nodes to form a federated network. Can register domains and serve as a mirror for other nodes.

### Multi-Network Support

NEXUS supports simultaneous operation across multiple networks with different scopes and security boundaries:

- **Network Isolation**: Run multiple network instances simultaneously with strict isolation between them
- **Independent Contexts**: Maintain separate configuration, credentials, and state for each network
- **Scope-Based Routing**: Route requests to the appropriate network based on domain scope and request type
- **Cross-Network Policy**: Define explicit policies for how/if information can flow between networks
- **Network Profiles**: Save and switch between different network configurations easily

Example Multi-Network Configuration:
- A private home network for personal devices with local-only TLDs
- A federated work network with access to company resources and controlled sharing
- A public hypermesh connection for accessing the broader community
- Ephemeral P2P connections for direct device-to-device communication without exposing other networks

Each network operates with its own independent:
- Certificate authorities and trust chains
- Peer lists and connection policies
- DNS records and resolution paths
- Resource access controls
- Performance and security settings

Networks can be activated, deactivated, or reconfigured independently without affecting other connections.

## Advanced Configuration

### Certificate Management

NEXUS uses Falcon quantum-resistant certificates for authentication. Custom certificates can be specified in profile configurations:

```bash
./build/nexus_cli edit-profile home ca_cert_path /path/to/ca.cert
./build/nexus_cli edit-profile home cert_path /path/to/node.cert
./build/nexus_cli edit-profile home private_key_path /path/to/private.key
```

### Network Tuning

Optimize network performance:

```bash
# Adjust connection parameters
./build/nexus_cli edit-profile home max_tunnels 20

# Enable NAT traversal for complex networks
./build/nexus_cli edit-profile home enable_nat_traversal true
```

### Multiple Instances

Run multiple NEXUS instances with different configurations:

```bash
# Start first instance on default ports
./build/nexus --profile home

# Start second instance with custom ports in a different terminal
./build/nexus --profile public --server-port 20053 --client-port 20443
```

## NEXUS and Hypermesh Integration

NEXUS is designed to function both as a standalone protocol and as the core networking layer for the Hypermesh framework (codename NKrypt). This dual-purpose architecture ensures maximum flexibility while providing seamless integration between networking and blockchain components.

### Modular Architecture

NEXUS follows a "Core-Extensions" architecture pattern:

- **Core Components**: Standalone functionality that operates independently
  - QUIC Transport Layer
  - DNS Resolution System
  - Certificate Management
  - Connection Handling
  - TLD/Domain Management

- **Extension Interfaces**: Well-defined integration points for Hypermesh
  - Asset Resolution Bridge
  - Blockchain Connector
  - Token Authentication
  - Advanced Distributed Features

This separation allows NEXUS to operate in both standalone mode and as an integrated component of the larger Hypermesh ecosystem.

### Interface Architecture

NEXUS provides a standardized interface layer for Hypermesh integration:

1. **Dynamic Component Registry**
   - Runtime registration of both core and extension components
   - Capability discovery and feature negotiation
   - Graceful degradation when Hypermesh components aren't available
   - Plugin architecture for extended functionality

2. **Asset Resolution Interface**
   - Extensions to DNS resolution for blockchain assets
   - Mapping between traditional domains and asset identifiers
   - Caching optimized for both DNS and asset resolution
   - Unified query interface spanning both systems

3. **Token Verification**
   - Support for token-based authentication across network boundaries
   - Verification of token validity against blockchain state
   - Caching of token verification results for performance
   - Rate limiting and protection against token-based attacks

### Integration Patterns

When operating as part of the Hypermesh ecosystem, NEXUS:

1. **Delegates Asset Management** to NKrypt:
   - Asset creation, validation, and state management remain in NKrypt
   - NEXUS focuses on asset discovery, resolution, and network communication
   - Clear separation of concerns between network and blockchain layers

2. **Provides Communication Infrastructure** for NKrypt:
   - Secure QUIC-based transport for all Hypermesh communications
   - Multi-path routing for resilient blockchain operations
   - Efficient block and transaction propagation
   - Connection management optimized for blockchain workloads

3. **Enables Cross-Network Operations**:
   - Discovery of assets across network boundaries
   - Secure communication between different Hypermesh instances
   - Token-based authentication for cross-network operations
   - Bandwidth and resource management for network-spanning requests

### Configuration and Deployment

NEXUS can be configured for different operational modes:

```json
{
  "mode": "standalone",  // or "integrated"
  "hypermesh_interface": {
    "enabled": true,
    "registry_endpoint": "http://localhost:8545",
    "token_verification": true,
    "asset_resolution": true
  }
}
```

This configuration-driven approach allows for flexible deployment scenarios:

- **Standalone Mode**: NEXUS operates as an independent DNS-over-QUIC service
- **Integrated Mode**: NEXUS works in concert with Hypermesh components
- **Hybrid Mode**: NEXUS provides both standalone services and Hypermesh integration

### Development and Extension

Developers can extend NEXUS's capabilities through:

1. **Interface Implementation**: Creating new implementations of standard interfaces
2. **Component Registration**: Registering components with the dynamic registry
3. **Protocol Extensions**: Developing new message types and handlers
4. **Custom Resolvers**: Implementing specialized resolution for different asset types

The plugin architecture ensures that NEXUS can evolve alongside the Hypermesh ecosystem while maintaining its core functionality as a standalone protocol.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run the unit tests to verify individual components:

```bash
make test
```
