# HyperMesh Network Design Document

as a high level overview - the goal is that users can connect to the hypermesh.online network and register an official http3 tld and run distributed networks via their distributed dns registration, or potentially run their own private or ephemeral networks this way as well.

review our codebase to ensure that we are making this requirement possible in our /src/* files and in our /*.md files 


## 1. Core Concepts

### 1.1. Client-Server Duality
Every node in the HyperMesh network operates simultaneously as both a client and a server. This peer-to-peer architecture is fundamental to the network's decentralized nature.

### 1.2. Network Interfaces
Each client possesses three distinct network interfaces:

*   **Private Interface:** Facilitates secure peer-to-peer (P2P) or peer-to-many connections. These can be used for federated networks or direct, trusted communication channels.
*   **Ephemeral Interface:** Enables P2P or peer-to-many anonymous tunnels. This interface prioritizes privacy and temporary connections, leaving minimal trace.
*   **Public Interface:** Used for general network interaction and visibility where anonymity or strict privacy is not the primary concern.

### 1.3. Transport Protocol: QUIC/HTTP3
The entire HyperMesh network leverages the QUIC protocol, and by extension HTTP/3. This provides benefits such as reduced latency, improved congestion control, and built-in encryption (TLS 1.3).

### 1.4. Decentralized DNS with Centralized Entry Point
*   **Centralized Authoritative Server:** A primary DNS server, `dns.hypermesh.online`, will serve as the authoritative source for HyperMesh TLDs.
*   **Node Caching & Mirroring:** Every active node in the HyperMesh network will act as a DNS mirror, caching records to improve lookup speeds and resilience. This creates a distributed DNS resolution system with a centralized point for updates and new TLD registration.

### 1.5. Block-Matrix Grid
*   **Matrix-type Grid:** The network topology is conceptualized as a matrix or grid, allowing for complex interconnections and routing.
*   **Private Blockchains:** Each client maintains its own private blockchain.
*   **Block-Matrix Connection:** The combination of the grid topology and individual private blockchains enables a "block-matrix" connection system. This suggests that interactions and data provenance can be tracked and verified across the network through a combination of these private ledgers. (Further elaboration needed on the specifics of this interaction).

## 2. Development Roadmap

The development of the HyperMesh network will proceed in the following phases:

### Phase 1: Core DNS Infrastructure
*   **Objective:** Establish the centralized DNS server (`dns.hypermesh.online`).
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Ability to register and manage custom Top-Level Domains (TLDs) within the HyperMesh network.
    *   DNS resolution accessible via HTTP/3 endpoints.
    *   Mechanism for nodes to query and cache DNS records.

### Phase 2: HyperMesh Communication API
*   **Objective:** Develop an API that enables communication and interaction between nodes using their private HyperMesh chains.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Secure messaging and data exchange between nodes.
    *   Functions for interacting with the private blockchains (e.g., writing entries, querying state).
    *   API endpoints for managing connections across the block-matrix.

### Phase 3: Nexus Framework SDK
*   **Objective:** Create a Software Development Kit (SDK) to simplify interaction with the HyperMesh API.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   High-level abstractions for common network operations.
    *   Libraries and tools for a custom HyperMesh language, "Nexus Framework," designed for ease of use with the API.
    *   Documentation and examples for developers.

## 3. Further Considerations (To Be Expanded)
*   Security model for private and ephemeral interfaces.
*   Specifics of the "block-matrix connection" and how private blockchains interact.
*   Scalability and performance of the DNS mirroring system.
*   Governance model for `dns.hypermesh.online` and TLD registration.
*   Data synchronization and consensus mechanisms if private blockchains need to interact or share state.
*   Detailed specifications for the Nexus Framework language.
